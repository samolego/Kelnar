## Sample Data

The app comes with sample products to get you started:
- Burger ($12.99)
- Hot Dog ($8.50)
- French Fries ($4.99)
- Coca Cola ($2.50)
- Pizza Margherita ($15.99)

## Customization

### Adding New Features
The app is built with extensibility in mind. You can easily:
- Add new fields to orders (customer name, phone number)
- Implement different pricing models (discounts, taxes)
- Add receipt printing functionality
- Integrate with POS systems
- Add cloud synchronization

### Modifying UI
- Colors and themes can be changed in the Material Design 3 color scheme
- Layout and spacing can be adjusted in individual screen composables
- Icons can be replaced with custom designs

## Data Location

### Android
```
/data/data/io.github.samolego.kelnar/shared_prefs/kelnar_prefs.xml
```

### Desktop
```
~/.kelnar/data.properties
```

### Web
```
Browser localStorage (accessible via browser dev tools)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **App crashes on startup**
   - Check if storage permissions are granted (Android)
   - Verify JDK version is 11+

2. **Data not persisting**
   - Check storage permissions
   - Verify localStorage is enabled (Web)

3. **Build errors**
   - Clean and rebuild: `./gradlew clean build`
   - Check Kotlin and Compose versions compatibility

### Performance Tips

- The app is optimized for local storage and should handle hundreds of orders efficiently
- Large numbers of products (1000+) may cause slower search performance
- Regular cleanup of completed orders can improve performance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA with Kotlin Multiplatform plugin

- Implement different pricing models (discounts, taxes)
- Add receipt printing functionality
- Integrate with POS systems
- Add cloud synchronization

### Modifying UI

- Layout and spacing can be adjusted in individual screen composables
- Icons can be replaced with custom designs
- Tab styling and badges can be customized in OrdersScreen

## Data Location

### Android
```
/data/data/io.github.samolego.kelnar/shared_prefs/kelnar_prefs.xml
```

### Desktop
```
~/.kelnar/data.properties
```

### Web
```
Browser localStorage (accessible via browser dev tools)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **App crashes on startup**
   - Check if storage permissions are granted (Android)
   - Verify JDK version is 11+

2. **Data not persisting**
   - Check storage permissions
   - Verify localStorage is enabled (Web)

3. **Web routing not working**
   - Ensure you're accessing the development server URL (usually http://localhost:8080)
   - Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser
   - Clear browser cache and refresh
   - For bookmarked URLs, make sure the development server is running

4. **Build errors**
   - Clean and rebuild: `./gradlew clean build`
   - Check Kotlin and Compose versions compatibility
   - Delete `.gradle` and `build` directories if cache issues persist

### Performance Tips

- The app is optimized for local storage and should handle hundreds of orders efficiently
- Large numbers of products (1000+) may cause slower search performance
- Regular cleanup of completed orders can improve performance
